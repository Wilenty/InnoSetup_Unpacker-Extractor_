At the outset. I know the names of (Inno) "Unpacker" and "Extractor" are taken, but I have not found suitable substitutes, so I had no choice...

There are few programs of this type, but none of them correctly extracts (recreates/recovers) the *.iss script of IS 6.3.x-6.4.x(-dev), so I creted my own.
Also, none of them extracts external [files] entries, as well the "Attribs" and "Permissions" of them.

I had prepared simple example for you to compile in the IS 6.3.x-6.4.x, so compare extracted script values between the test script with this program and other unpackers/extractors of InnoSetup.

If you want to extract specific file from the InnoSetup installer, or other version of IS between 5.6.x (Unicode) and 6.4.x, or files for specific CPU architecture, or specific [type] and/or [component] from the InnoSetup installer - please support me (and my work) on ko-fi or Patreon.
